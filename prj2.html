      This Net Art projects is a website that lets people explore my 3D art in a way that wouldn’t be possible in any other medium. 
      Instead of just looking at pictures, users can interact with my models—rotating, zooming, and viewing them from all angles. 
      This makes the experience more engaging and brings my environment and asset designs to life.
    </p>
    <p>Technically, the website is built with HTML and CSS for structure and style, while JavaScript adds interactivity by allowing users to view models in fullscreen mode. 
      The site is also responsive, meaning it works well on different screen sizes, so anyone can access it easily. I use Iframe as you advice on Canvas. I'm using a lot of iframes and I use sketchfab as the main source to let users preview my 3D art through the site.   <p>
    
    
        <p>This project works best on the internet because it takes full advantage of web technology. A physical portfolio or a printed image wouldn’t allow people to move and explore 3D models in real-time. 
          The dark-themed design of the website helps keep the focus on the artwork, while the simple layout makes navigation easy. <p>
    
                
                
  <p> Overall, this project is more than just a collection of my work—it’s a space where people can truly experience my 3D art interactively. 
                  The internet allows me to share my creations in a way that is both dynamic and engaging, making this portfolio a unique and immersive showcase of my skills.<p>
